 <h1><b>What is Rap?</b></h1>
<img src="rap.png" style="width:34%; border-radius: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
 <p>
 <b>Rap</b> is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyming, rhythmic speech". 
 It is performed or chanted, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment. 
 The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm/rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone).
 Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off-time to musical accompaniment.
 Rap is a primary ingredient of hip hop music commonly associated with that genre, 
 however, the origins of rap predate hip-hop culture by many years.</p>
 
 <p>Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, beatboxer, 
 or performed a cappella without accompaniment. 
 Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. 
 The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike", 
 and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. 
 The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. 
 It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", 
 and very soon after that came to denote the musical style. 
 The word "rap" is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.</p>

<h1><b>The History of Rap</b></h1>
<hr>
<p><img src="kurtis.png" style="width:20%">
<br><i>Kurtis Blow</i></p>
 
<p><i>World Cafe</i> celebrates Black History Month with a special on the birth of rap, 
 in which rapper Kurtis Blow, DJ Grand Wizard Theodore, and museum curator Jim Fricke help host David Dye explore the birth of hip-hop. 
 Kurtis Blow was the first rapper to sign with a major label, the first to earn a certified gold single, 
 and the first to tour internationally. 
 Grand Wizard Theodore was the DJ who invented scratching, utilizing turntables as an instrument to be played. 
 Jim Fricke is the editor of <i>Yes Yes Y'all: The Experience Music Project Oral History of Hip Hop's First Decade</i>, 
 and was the curator of the "Hip-Hop Nation" exhibit at Seattle's Experience Music Project. 
 Together, they tell the story of rap's early years in the 1970s.</p>
 
<p>Rap as a genre began at block parties in New York City in the early 1970s, 
 when DJs began isolating the percussion breaks of funk, soul, and disco songs and extending them. 
 MCs tasked with introducing the DJs and keeping the crowd energized would talk between songs, 
 joking and generally interacting with the audience. Over time, it became common for the MCs (or rappers, as they soon became known) 
 to talk and rhyme over and in sync with the music. 
 Initially dismissed as a fad, 
 rap music proved its commercial viability in 1979 with the release of The Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," 
 and then again in 1980 with Kurtis Blow's "The Breaks," a Top 5 hit that eventually went gold.</p>

<h2><b>What We Need to Know About Rap</b></h2>
 <img src="write.png" style="width:34%; border-radius: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
 <p>Rap is a complex mix of influences, including elements of speech, prose, poetry, and song. 
 Learn to rap by listening to the masters, learning rhythms, and practicing your own lyrics.
 You don't always have to write your own lyrics if you struggle to do so. 
 Instead, go search for a writer or ask your friends to write something down for you, 
 because not all people are good at both rapping and writing.</p>
 <p>Same with producing the instruments, you don't have to master instruments that they use in Hip Hop music, 
 find someone that can produce a beat for you, if the beat suits you, 
 then you can start to spit some BARS (a slang term that they use for rapping)</p>

<h2><b>2 Types of Rap in 2023</b></h2>
 <p>As time goes by, we got introduced to a new type of raps, including <i>Mumble Rap</i> and <i>Lyrical Rap</i>.
 Let me explain what both of those are.</p>
 <h4><b>Mumble Rapping</b></h4>
 <p><img src="lilpump.png" style="width:20%">
 <br><i>Lil Pump</i></p>
 <p>Mumble rap is a loosely defined genre of hip hop that largely spread on the online audio distribution platform 
 SoundCloud in the 2010s. The term implies a mumbling or unclear vocal delivery by artists, 
 and may generally refer to rappers who do not share the genre's traditional emphasis on lyricism.
 In 2018, the phrase "Soundcloud rappers" has also been used to refer to this new generation of young rappers, 
 replacing the denigrating label "mumble rappers". 
 While the term has been widely criticized as inaccurate or as a derogatory term, some artists have reclaimed the term.
 Some have defended the style as a new phase in the evolution of the genre.</p>
 <hr>
 <h4><b>Lyrical Rap</b></h4>
 <p><img src="eminem.png" style="width:20%">
 <br><i>Eminem</i></p>
 <p>Lyrical Rap is basically the type of Rap that was introduced since the beginning.
 People call rappers "Lyrical" when they are very wordy or technical in their craft or putting their bars together. 
 Rhyme schemes, extended metaphors, wordplay, etc.</p>
